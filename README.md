# Pi-tingz
stuff  

This is just a basic quicky git repo for random Raspberry Pi things that I find useful and perhaps people may find helpful
versus manually keying in every file. just git clone link then edit and move the files into their appropriate locations.


As of this moment the files worked on relevant locations are::

/etc/network/interfaces


/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

The wpa_supplicant.conf works for a wpa2 hidden ap. Please refer to (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant) for
more references or examples. Anything Debian - Wpa_supplicant related should be able to help.
